This is a place where I try to solve various math challenges from [project euler](http://project-euler.net).

At this point, there is nearly no content here yet. 
  
I'm just getting started with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the blog-aware static site generator that power GitHub Pages. 
I still have to figure out  how to add interactive code snippets and spoiler buttons (hide the solution until you press the spoiler button).
