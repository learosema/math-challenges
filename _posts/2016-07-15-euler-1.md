## Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

{% include playground.html %}

<script type="text/html" class="test">
return result(1000) === 233168
</script>

## Solving it programmatically in JavaScript

Here is my solution in JavaScript. 
<div class="spoiler">
{% highlight javascript %}
const result = (n) => { 
    let i, j;
    for(j = 0, i = n; i--;)
        j += (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) ? i : 0; 
    return j; 
}

result(10);   // 23 (as expected)
result(1000); // 233168

{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Solving it programmatically is easy, but

What if you don't have a computer next to you, and you don't want to iterate manually through all natural numbers?

<!-- <p>That's where the little gaussian formular comes in handy:</p>

$$\sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{(n^2+n)}{2}$$
