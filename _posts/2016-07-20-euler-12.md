The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 

$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$$

The first ten terms would be:

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
<pre>
 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
</pre>

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?


## My solution

<div class="spoiler">

<p>For now, only bruteforce.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
const tri = (n) => (n*n+n)/2

const numDivisors = (n) => {
    let c = n!=1 ? 2:1, sqrN = Math.sqrt(n);
    for (let i=2; i<=sqrN; i++)
        if(n%i==0) c += i!=n/i ? 2:1
    return c;
}

const result = (n) => {
    let i=1;
    for(i=1;i<1e6;i++) {
        let t = tri(i)
        if (numDivisors(t)>n) return t
    }
    return -1;
}

result(5)   // 28
result(500) // 76576500

{% endhighlight %}

<p>It is really slow (about 950ms) .</p>
