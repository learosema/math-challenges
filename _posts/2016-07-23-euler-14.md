title:  "Euler Problem 14: Longest Collatz sequence"

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

$$n → n/2 (n=even)$$

$$n → 3n + 1 (n=odd)$$

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

$$13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

**NOTE**: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.


## JavaScript playground
<pre class="edit">
const result = () => {
}
</pre>
<button class="test" id="buttonTest0"> run test </button>
<script type="text/html" class="test" id="test0">
(result() == 837799)
</script>

## My solution

<div class="spoiler">

<p>It can be bruteforced:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}

// returns the length of the Collatz sequence with the starting number n
const collatz = (n) => {
    let r = 0;
    while (n>1) r++, n = n % 2 == 1 ? (3*n+1) : n/2;
    r++;
    return r;
}

const result = () => {
    let l = 0, r = -1;
    for(let i=0; i<1e6; i++) {
        let c = collatz(i);
        if (c > l) l=c,r=i;
    }
    return r;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The result is 837799. The runtime is 3242.765ms. It's really slow, so let's try to optimize it:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
const colMap = []; 

// returns the length of the Collatz sequence with the starting number n
// For optimization, previous results are stored in the colMap array, 
// so we don't have to calculate the length again.
// Additionally, we don't need to check if the number is even after we made a 3*n+1 step, 
// because for all odd numbers 2x+1: 3*(2x+1) = 6x+4 = 2*(3x+2) is always divisible by 2.
const collatz = (n) => {
    let r = 0, n1 = n;
    let x = 1;
    while (n1>1) {
        x = colMap[n1]||1
        if (x>1) break;
        if (n1 % 2 == 1)r++,n1=(3*n1+1)
        r++
        n1 /= 2
    }
    colMap[n]= r + x;
    return r + x;
}

const result = () => {
    let l = 0, r = -1;
    for(let i=0; i<1e6; i++) {
        let c = collatz(i);
        if (c > l) l=c,r=i;
    }
    return r;
}

console.time("x"); result(500); console.timeEnd("x");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If we cache the results in an array, the runtime improves to 290.864ms.</p>
