You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

 - 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
 - Thirty days has September,
 - April, June and November.
 - All the rest have thirty-one,
 - Saving February alone,
 - Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 - And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 - A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
 - How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

## My solution

<div class="spoiler">
{% highlight javascript %}
// 1 jan 2000: saturday
// 1 jan 2001: monday
// 1 jan 2002: tuesday
// 1 jan 2003: wednesday
// 1 jan 2004: thursday
// 1 jan 2005: saturday

const getStartDay = (y) => {
    const start1900 = 0; // I'm german, we start counting from monday
    let   result    = start1900
    for (let x=0; y<1900; x++) {}


}

const sundays = (y) => {
    y = 2016;
    startDay = 4;
    for (let m = 0; m <= 11; m++) {
        let days = 31;
        if (m==3||m==5||m==8||m==10) days--
        if (m==1 && y % 4 == 0) days++; // add one day in february on leap years

    }
}

sundays(1900) // x
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
