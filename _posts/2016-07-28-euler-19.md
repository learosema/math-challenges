You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

 - 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
 - Thirty days has September,
 - April, June and November.
 - All the rest have thirty-one,
 - Saving February alone,
 - Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 - And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 - A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

## JavaScript playground

<pre class="edit">
const result = () => {
        
}

result()
</pre>
<button class="test" id="buttonTest0"> run test </button>
<script type="text/html" class="test" id="test0">
(result() == 171)
</script>


## My solution

<div class="spoiler">
{% highlight javascript %}

// Some research:
//
// 1 jan 2000: saturday     leap year: +2   
// 1 jan 2001: monday       +1
// 1 jan 2002: tuesday      +1
// 1 jan 2003: wednesday    +1
// 1 jan 2004: thursday     leap year: +2
// 1 jan 2005: saturday
// let's travel back:
// 1 jan 1900: monday       +1 (no leap year)
// 1 jan 1901: tuesday      

const getDaysOfMonth = (y, m) => {
    if (m==1) return y%4==0?29:28
    if (m==3||m==5||m==8||m==10) return 30
    return 31
}

const result = () => {
    let r=0;
    let start = 1; // 1901-01-01 was a tuesday
    for(let y=1901; y <= 2000; y++) {
        for(let m=0; m < 12; m++) {
            if (start == 6) r++;
            start = (start + getDaysOfMonth(y,m))%7
        }
    }
    return r;
}
