This is a place where I try to solve various math challenges from [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/). 
I'm using JavaScript ES6 to solve the problems programmatically.
In my posts, I also provide a simple JavaScript playground where you can try things out.

Additionally, my solutions are hidden via a spoiler component. 
That one isn't perfect yet, but it hides the solution until you want to see it.

Alongside personal math training, it's also a learning-by-doing thing to get started with Jekyll, the blog-aware static site generator that power GitHub Pages. 
I still have to figure many things out.

If you have suggestions, spot any mistakes or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to contact me â˜º.

Have a lot of fun!
