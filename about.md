This is a place where I try to solve various math challenges from [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/) programmatically with ES6 JavaScript. 

In my posts, I also provide a simple JavaScript playground where you can try things out. 
Additionally, my solutions are hidden via a spoiler component. The solution is revealed after you tap or hover on it. 

At this point, the playground and the spoiler component aren't perfect yet. 

I will improve the features of this site over time, babystep by babystep. Alongside personal math training, it's also a learning-by-doing thing to get started with Jekyll, 
the blog-aware static site generator that power GitHub Pages. I still have to figure many things out.

If you have suggestions, spot any mistakes or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to contact me â˜º.

Have a lot of fun!
