This is a place where I try to solve various math challenges from project euler. 
In my posts, I provide a simple JavaScript playground where you can try things out. Additionally, my solutions are hidden via a spoiler component. 

It's a learning-by-doing thing to get started with Jekyll, the blog-aware static site generator that power GitHub Pages. 
I still have to figure things out.

If you spot any mistakes, please let me know â˜º.

Have a lot of fun!
